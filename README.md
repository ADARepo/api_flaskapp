This is the API portion of an application named Carebit. It is an app that syncs a user's Fitbit and their data (with permission) to Carebit for display to a third party (a caregiver).
I worked on the API in the third iteration of this project and this is what it looks like upon completion of the semester spent working on it.
Connections to a remote server hosted on DigitalOcean which also contains our MySQL database.

TODO's:
- Better comments surrounding functions and endpoints
- Better error handling/structure of error handling (more consistency in the error handling especially)
    - Two other teams worked on this so it's also a result of different people having different styles
